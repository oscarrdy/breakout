FIXME: 
In rare edge cases, a movable object may have moved enough during a single frame that the
collision side is incorrectly determine, causing its trajectory to be incorrectly updated.
May be fixed by tracking the previous position of all movable objects.
Severity: low
Likelihood: low

TODO:
Decouple the blast radius logic from the ball and brick collision logic to allow scaling with
other powerups.
Can make a separate private function within that file.

TODO:
Start using static dimension properties and centralize sizing logic to easily handle resizing.
Make the game live responsive.

TODO:
Sound effects and background music.

TODO:
More powerups:
- Multi-ball
- Armour-piercing (does not bounce of the brick it collides with)
- 2x score multiplier
- Reversed controls
- Reduced vision (temporarily hide the bricks and powerups except for a circle around the ball)
- Curse ball (temporarily makes it repair bricks instead of damaging them)

TODO:
Add a final level with a boss fight
